## 🚀 Features

- **Classic Snake, Modern Vibe**: Enjoy the simple and addictive gameplay you love, reimagined with a vibrant, glowing, retro-futuristic style.
- **Three Dynamic Difficulty Modes**:
    - **Easy**: Perfect for beginners. The food is stationary, and there are no obstacles. A chill mode to learn the ropes.
    - **Medium**: The standard snake experience. The food (a rat) now moves around the grid, making it a trickier target.
    - **Hard**: For the ultimate challenge! The food moves, and randomly generated wall obstacles appear, forcing you to navigate with precision.
- **Engaging Gameplay Mechanics**:
    - **Dynamic Speed**: The game speed increases as you "level up" by eating more food, with the difficulty curve getting steeper in medium and hard modes.
    - **Tricky AI Food**: The rat has its own movement pattern, making it a challenging and unpredictable target.
- **Immersive Visuals & Sound**:
    - A beautiful, glowing, retro-inspired theme with CRT scanlines and an animated grid background.
    - Sound effects for key game events.
- **Responsive & Full-Screen**:
    - Play seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
    - Immerse yourself in the action with a distraction-free full-screen mode.
- **Firebase-Powered Features**:
    - **Authentication**: Sign up and log in to have your identity in the game.
